# HTML Files

You can chose to 
1) Paste a copy of your HTML code on your Tumblr page
or
2) Host your HTML code online as a live website and link to both the live website and your code using a GitHub account.

Option 2 will take a bit of work to set up.

---
Option 1 - The Simple Code Pasting Method
- Navigate to your tumblr blog
- Click on Text
<img src="../tumblrtext.png"/>
- Paste your HTML code into the box, and give your code a title. 
<img src="../tumblrtext2.png"/>

Option 2 - The More Advanced Github Method

You can add a link to your HTML projects on Tumblr.

In order to publish your HTML files that you have on your computer to the internet, you will need to create a GitHub account.

- Navigate to [www.github.com](www.github.com) and create an account.

- Choose the free option.

- Click "Finish sign up"

- Click "Set up Git"

- Follow the instructions. 

- Click Create a Repository, and follow the instructions.

- Go to your github repository

- Click on branch and type gh-pages:

- Make sure that you are in the gh-pages branch. Click to create a new file.
<img src="../newfilegithub.png"/>

- Name the file index.html and Paste the code for your website into this file. 
<img src="../creatingindexhtml.png"/>

- Scroll to the bottom and click Commit new file.

- Within 10 minutes your file will be displayed at http://[username].github.io/[repository]
Where [username] should be replaced with your username and [repository] should be replaced with the name of your repository. For example, if your username is apple and you named your repository project 1 you would go to http://apple.github.io/project1

- You can now paste this link into tumblr just as you did with your scratch projects. You should paste the link to your github repository (which should be github.com/[username]/[repository] e.g. github.com/apple/project1) so that people can see your code!

- Phew! Good job. You now have a github account and a github repository. Github is where most professional programmers share their code, and many programming jobs ask for a link to your github profile!
